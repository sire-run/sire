# Sire Design Ideals

This document outlines the core design principles that guide the development of Sire. It serves as a compass for all contributors to ensure that the project remains cohesive, maintainable, and true to its vision.

## 1. Developer-First Experience

The primary user of Sire is a developer. Every design decision should prioritize their experience.

- **CLI as a Primary Interface:** The command-line interface is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought. It should be powerful, scriptable, and provide full control over the system.
- **Workflows as Code:** Workflows are defined in human-readable text files (YAML or JSON). This allows them to be version-controlled in Git, code-reviewed, and edited with standard development tools.
- **Extensibility in Go:** Extending Sire with new functionality should feel natural to a Go developer. It should be as simple as writing a new function or implementing an interface.

## 2. Simplicity and Cohesion

Sire is a reaction to the complexity of existing workflow automation platforms.

- **Minimal Boilerplate:** Creating new nodes or workflows should require the minimum amount of boilerplate code. We prefer convention over configuration.
- **Cohesive Architecture:** The project should have a clean, logical, and well-structured architecture. We avoid the fragmentation of a micro-package system, instead grouping related code by its domain.
- **Limited Abstractions:** We will use abstractions only where they provide clear benefits. We avoid over-engineering and unnecessary layers of indirection.

## 3. Performance by Default

Sire is built in Go to be fast and efficient.

- **Concurrency:** We leverage Go's powerful concurrency model to execute workflows in a highly parallel and efficient manner.
- **Low Resource Footprint:** The compiled binary should be lightweight and have a low memory footprint, making it suitable for a wide range of environments, from small servers to containerized deployments.
- **Standard Library First:** To keep the project lean and fast, we prefer to use the Go standard library wherever possible, only introducing third-party dependencies when they provide a significant advantage.

## 4. Decoupled Architecture

The core engine is, and must remain, completely decoupled from any specific user interface or client.

- **Engine as a Library:** The core of Sire is a Go library that can be embedded in other applications.
- **APIs over Integration:** All user-facing applications (like the CLI or the MCP server) are clients of the core engine's API. They are not tightly integrated into the engine itself.
- **Interchangeable Frontends:** This decoupling allows for multiple, independent frontends to be developed in the future (e.g., a web UI, a desktop app, etc.) without requiring any changes to the core engine.

## 5. Testability

A robust and reliable system is a testable one.

- **Unit Tests for Everything:** Every new feature, bug fix, or change must be accompanied by comprehensive unit tests. We aim for 100% test coverage on all new code.
- **Design for Testability:** We use techniques like dependency injection (where it doesn't violate simplicity) and interfaces to ensure that all components can be easily tested in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** In addition to unit tests, we will have a suite of integration tests that verify the interaction between different components of the system.
